<title>Fender Telecaster Guitar</title>
<conbody>
<p>Look at this cool guitar.</p>
<p>Telecaster shares the form of the conventional (acoustic) guitar.
At the transition from the head to the neck there is a recess, a so
called cutaway, at the lower surface, thus comfortable playing is
possible in high situations.</p>
