   &lt;title>About forward&lt;/title>
   &lt;shortdesc>You can ask the system to forward all your 
      calls to another extension or to an outside telephone 
      number.&lt;/shortdesc>
   &lt;conbody>
      &lt;p>When you forward your calls, an inside and 
         outside calls are forwarded to another extension. 
         While your phone is in "call forwarding," you will 
         hear a single ring to remind you that you are using 
         this feature.&lt;/p>
      &lt;p>You also have the ability to forward your calls 
         in a chain with up to four forwards. With 
         chaining, call A will forward to phone B, phone B 
         to phone C, and so on. The fourth phone will always 
         ring even if it is also on call forwarding.&lt;/p>
      &lt;p>And, if you have programmed a distinctive ring 
         for your phone, the extension that receives your 
         forwarded calls will ring your calls with the same 
         distinctive sound.&lt;/p>
