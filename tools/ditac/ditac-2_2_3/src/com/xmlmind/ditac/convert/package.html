Implementation of the <tt>ditac</tt> command-line utility.

<p><tt>com.xmlmind.ditac.convert.Converter</tt>, the class which is at 
the core of the <tt>ditac</tt> command-line utility, has been designed 
in order to be easily embedded in any Java desktop or server-side application.
However a lower-level alternative to embedding Converter consists in embedding 
<tt>com.xmlmind.ditac.preprocess.PreProcessor</tt>.
