Implementation of <tt>com.xmlmind.ditac.preprocess.PreProcessor</tt>,
the ditac preprocessor.

<p>The PreProcessor converts a DITA map file (or a list of topic files, in
which case a DITA map is generated on the fly) to one or more <tt>.ditac</tt>
files and a single <tt>ditac_lists.ditac_lists</tt> file.

<p>The PreProcessor has been designed in order to be easily embedded 
in any Java desktop or server-side application. However an even easier 
alternative to embedding PreProcessor consists in embedding 
<tt>com.xmlmind.ditac.convert.Converter</tt>.
