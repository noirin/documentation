 <conbody>
 	<p>Before you can run instances from VM images that you created or downloaded, you must first
 		prepare these images for use in the cloud by bundling  them with your credentials, uploading
 		them, and registering them with Eucalyptus. This section introduces Euca2ools commands for
 		performing these and other important image management tasks. For instructions about managing
 		Windows images, see <xref href="managing_win_images.dita"/>.</p>
