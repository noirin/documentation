 	<p>A Eucalyptus Machine Image (EMI) is a special type of pre-packaged operating system and application software that Eucalyptus uses to create a virtual machine instance. An EMI contains all necessary information to boot instances of your software. An EMI can contain whatever software you want to meet your needs. For example, you can create an EMI to act as an application server, or a web server, or a custom web service.
 	The following sections contain information to help you create, configure, and modify EMIs.</p>
 	<p>Managing EMIs requires that you do source your eucarc file before performing the associated
 		tasks. For more information, see <xref href="../install_guide/setting_up_admin_creds.dita"/>.</p>
<note type="important" >All users can upload and register images, depending on their access. However, only the admin user can upload and register kernels or ramdisks.</note>
