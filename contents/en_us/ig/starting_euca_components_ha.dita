 <title>Starting Components: HA</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
 	<p>In a HA setup, each component except for NCs has a redundant backup. The start process for an HA installation is the same as in a non-HA installation. However the start process is duplicated for each redundant pair of components.</p> 
 	<p>We recommend that you start components in pairs, as listed in the following process table.</p>
