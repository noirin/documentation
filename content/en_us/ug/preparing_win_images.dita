 <title>Adding a Windows Image</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
 	<p>To prepare a Windows VM image for use in Eucalyptus, follow the standard bundle/upload/register
 		steps used for preparing Linux images <!--(see <xref href="managing_lin_images.dita"/>)-->, keeping in mind these
 		differences:</p>
 	<ul>
 		<li>The filename of your Windows image must begin with the string <filepath>windows</filepath>. For
 			example, <filepath>windows.my2008server.img</filepath>.</li>
 		<li>You don't use kernel and ramdisk images when you bundle a Windows image.</li>
 		<li>Bundling a Windows image can take several minutes, depending on the size of your image and the configuration of the machine on which you are running the bundling task.</li> 
 	</ul>
 	<note type="important">Before you begin preparing an image, confirm that you have installed the latest
 		version of Euca2ools client tools. If necessary, see your administrator for assistance.</note>
