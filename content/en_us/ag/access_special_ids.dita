 <conbody>
 	
 	<p>Eucalyptus has two special identities for the convenience of administration and use of the system.</p>
 	<ul>
 	<li>The <b>eucalyptus</b> account: This is like the root group in a Linux system. Every user in the eucalyptus account has full access to the resources in the system. These users are often referred to as sys admin or cloud admin. This account is automatically created when the system starts for the first time. You can not remove eucalyptus account from the system.</li>
 	<li>The <b>admin</b> user of an account: Each account, including the eucalyptus account, has a user named admin by default, i.e. created automatically by the system when an account is created. The admin of an account has full access to the resources owned by the account. You can not remove the admin user from an account. The admin can delegate resource access to other users in the account by using policies.</li>
 	</ul>
