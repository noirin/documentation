	<title>Restart the CC</title>
	<shortdesc></shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>You can start the CC two different ways. A normal restart causes the CC to re-parse the eucalyptus.conf file without resetting the networking state of the cloud. This means that the CC maintains routes, firewall rules, IP assignments for running VMs. This is how you restart under normal circumstances.</p>
		<p>A clean restart causes the CC to reset the networking configuration it maintains. The CC clears any existing network configuration regardless of whether it is in use.  That is, a clean restart of a CC managing active VMs can cause the network connectivity they are using to be irreparably lost. We recommend that you only perform this type of restart when you change network modes.</p>
