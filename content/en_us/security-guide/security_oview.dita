		<p>This guide covers available controls and best practices for securing your Eucalyptus
			cloud. Cloud security depends on security across many layers of infrastructure and
			technology:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Security of the physical infrastructure and hosts</li>
			<li>Security of the virtual infrastructure</li>
			<li>Security of instances</li>
			<li>Security of storage and data</li>
			<li>Security of users and accounts</li>
		</ul>
		<note type="tip">For information about securing applications in AWS cloud, we recommend the
