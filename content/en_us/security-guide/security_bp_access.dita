      <title>Identity and Access Management</title>
      <p>Eucalyptus manages access control through an authentication, authorization, and accounting
        system. This system manages user identities, enforces access controls over resources, and
        provides reporting on resource usage as a basis for auditing and managing cloud activities.
        The user identity organizational model and the scheme of authorizations used to access
        resources are based on and compatible with the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
        system, with some Eucalyptus extensions provided that support ease-of-use in a private cloud
        environment.</p>
      <p>For a general introduction to IAM in Eucalyptus, see <xref
          href="../admin-guide/concepts_eiam.dita"/> in the Administration Guide. For information
        about using IAM quotas to enforce limits on resource usage by users and accounts in
        Eucalyptus, see the <xref href="../admin-guide/access_policy_quota.dita"/> section in the
        Administration Guide.</p>
      <p>The <xref href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAMBestPractices.html"
          scope="external" format="html">Amazon Web Services IAM Best Practices</xref> are also
        generally applicable to Eucalyptus.</p>

      <title>The <codeph>eucalyptus</codeph> Account</title>
      <p>The <codeph>eucalyptus</codeph> account is the superuser/privileged account in Eucalyptus.
        The security of your Eucalyptus cloud can be compromised if this account is compromised.</p>
      <p>For enhanced security, the <codeph>eucalyptus</codeph> account does not have a default
        password when Eucalyptus is initially installed, and you will be prompted for a password the
        first time you log in to the system. To set a password for the <codeph>eucalyptus</codeph>
        account during the install and configuration process, run the following commands:</p>
      <codeblock>euare-useraddloginprofile -u admin -p &lt;password>
euare-userupdateinfo -u admin -k email -i &lt;email></codeblock>
      <p>Use this account only for tasks that cannot be done using a less privileged account, for
        examples tasks related to cloud setup, management and monitoring. Protect and periodically
        rotate the credentials for this account.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Credential Management</title>
      <p>Only create users and credentials for the interfaces that you will actually use. For
        example, if you're only going to use an account through the Administration Console or the
        User Console, do not create credentials for the SOAP and Query interfaces.</p>
      <p>Using <codeph>euca_conf --get-credentials</codeph> or downloading credentials through the
        Administration Console currently creates a new set of X.509 certificates on each request.
        Use <codeph>euare-useraddkey</codeph> and <codeph>euare-usercreatecert</codeph> to get a
        specific set of credentials whenever possible.</p>
      <p>When rotating credentials, there is an option to deactivate, instead of removing, existing
        access/secret keys and X.509 certificates. Requests made using deactivated credentials will
        no longer be accepted, but the credentials will remain in the Eucalyptus database and can be
        restored if needed. You can deactive credentials using the Administration Console, or using
          <codeph>euare-usermodkey</codeph> and <codeph>euare-usermodcert</codeph>.</p>
