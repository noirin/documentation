	<title>Network and Message Security</title>
	<shortdesc>This section describes which networking mode is the most secure, and describes how to
		enforce message security.</shortdesc>

		<section>
			<title>Networking Mode</title>
			<p>Managed mode is the only recommended networking mode for secure deployments. It
				provides security groups, which are used to control inbound traffic to instances, as
				well as Layer-2 isolation between security groups. </p>
			<p>Layer-2 isolation is enforced using a VLAN tag per security group. This protects
				traffic within a security group from potential eavesdropping and hijacking by
				instances that belong to other security groups.</p>
			<p>Eucalyptus does not currently enforce Layer-2 isolation between instances within the
				same security group.
				<!--This protection will be
				available in the upcoming new Edge networking mode.--></p>
			<p>For more information about choosing a networking modes, see the Installation
				Guide.</p>

			<title>Replay Detection</title>
			<p>Eucalyptus components receive and exchange messages using either Query or SOAP
				interfaces (or both). Messages received over these interfaces are required to have a
				time stamp (as defined by AWS specification) to prevent message replay attacks.
				Because Eucalyptus enforces strict policies when checking timestamps in the received
				messages, for the correct functioning of the cloud infrastructure, it is crucial to
				have clocks constantly synchronized (for example, with ntpd) on all machines hosting
				Eucalyptus components. To prevent user commands failures, it is also important to
				have clocks synchronized on the client machines.</p>
			<p>Following the AWS specification, all Query interface requests containing the
				Timestamp element are rejected as expired after 15 minutes of the timestamp.
				Requests containing the Expires element expire at the time specified by the element.
				SOAP interface requests using WS-Security expire as specified by the WS-Security
				Timestamp element. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Endpoints</title>
			<p>Eucalyptus requires that all user requests (SOAP with WS-Security and Query) are
				signed, and that their content is properly hashed, to ensure integrity and
				non-repudiation of messages. For stronger security, and to ensure message
				confidentiality and server authenticity, client tools and applications should always
				use SSL/TLS protocols with server certification verification enabled for
				communications with Eucalyptus components.</p>
			<p>By default, Eucalyptus components are installed with self-signed certificates. For
				public Eucalyptus endpoints, certificates signed by a trusted CA provider should be
				installed.</p>
