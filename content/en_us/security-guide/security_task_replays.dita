	<title>Configure Replay Protection</title>
	<shortdesc/>
	<taskbody>
		<context>
			<p>You can configure replay detection in the CLC to allow replays of the same message
				for a set time period. This might be needed to ensure that legitimate requests
				submitted by automated scripts closely together (such as two requests to describe
				instances issued within the same second) are not rejected as malicious. </p>
			<note type="important">To protect against replay attacks, the CLC only caches messages
				for 15 minutes. So itâ€™s important that any client tools used to interact with the
				CLC have the Expires element set to a value less than 15 minutes from the current
				time. This is usually not an issue with standard tools, such as euca2ools and Amazon
				EC2 API Tools. </note>
		</context>
		<steps>
			<step>
				<cmd>The CLC replay detection algorithm rejects messages with the same signatures
					received within 15 minutes. The time within which messages with the same
					signatures are accepted is controlled by the
						<codeph>bootstrap.webservices.replay_skew_window_sec</codeph> property. The
					default value of this property is three seconds. To change this value, enter the
					following command:</cmd>
				<info>
					<codeblock>euca-modify-property -p bootstrap.webservices.replay_skew_window_sec=[new_value_in_seconds]</codeblock>
					<p>If you set this property to <codeph>0</codeph>, Eucalyptus will not allow any
						message replays. This setting provides the best protection against message
						replay attacks, but may break some of the client-side scripts that issue
						commands too quickly.</p>
					<p>If you set this property to any value greater than 15 minutes plus the values
						of ws.clock_skew_sec (that is, to a value >= 920 sec in the default
						installation), Eucalyptus disables replay detection completely.</p>
				</info>
			</step>
			<step>
				<cmd>When checking message timestamps for expiration, Eucalyptus allows up to 20
					seconds of clock drift between the machines. This is a default setting. You can
					change this value for the CLC at runtime by setting the
						<codeph>bootstrap.webservices.clock_skew_sec</codeph> property as
					follows:</cmd>
				<info>
					<codeblock>euca-modify-property -p bootstrap.webservices.clock_skew_sec=[new_value_in_seconds]</codeblock>
				</info>
