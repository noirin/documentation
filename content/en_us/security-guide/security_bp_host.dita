	<shortdesc>This section describes best practices for machines that host a Eucalyptus
		component.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>Eucalyptus recommends restricting physical and network access to all hosts comprising the
			Eucalyptus cloud, and disabling unused applications and ports on all machines used in
			your cloud.</p>
		<p>After installation, no local access to Eucalyptus component hosts is required for normal
			cloud operations and all normal cloud operations can be done over remote web service
			APIs.</p>
		<p>The CLC and Walrus are the only two components that generally expect remote connections
			from end users. Each Eucalyptus component can be put behind a firewall following the
			list of open ports and connectivity requirements described in the <xref
				href="../install-guide/configuring_iptables.dita">Configure the Firewall</xref>
			section.</p>
		<p>For more information on securing Red Hat hosts, see the <xref

				type="external" format="pdf">Red Hat Enterprise Linux Security Guide</xref>. Note
			that Eucalyptus does not currently support SELinux configurations, and SELinux should be
			disabled.</p>
