	<title>Verify the Startup</title>
	<shortdesc/>
	<conbody>
		<p>At this point, all Eucalyptus components are enabled and starting up. Some of these services
			perform intensive initialization at start-up, particularly the first time they are started.
			You might have to wait a few minutes until they are fully operational.</p>
		<p>One quick way to determine if the components are running is to run netstat on the various
			hosts and look to see when the service ports are allocated to a process. Specifically, the
			CLC, Walrus, the SC, and the VMware Broker allocate ports 8773. The CC listens to port 8774,
			and the NC uses port 8775.</p>
		<p>Verify that everything has started without error. Expected outcomes include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The CLC is listening on ports 8443 and 8773</li>
			<li>Walrus is listening on port 8773</li>
			<li>The SC is listening on port 8773</li>
			<li>If you are using the subscription only VMware Broker, it is listening on port 8773</li>
			<li>The CC is listening on port 8774</li>
			<li>The NCs are listening on port 8775</li>
			<li>Log files are being written to <filepath>/var/log/eucalyptus/</filepath></li>
		</ul>
